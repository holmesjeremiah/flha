Florida faces a high risk, with a 96% chance of being impacted by a named storm and a 75% chance of a hurricane. Colorado State University and AccuWeather forecasts suggest the season could be one of the busiest on record due to favorable conditions like warm Atlantic waters and reduced wind shear. Enhanced tools and new models will aid in forecasting and communication.",

While June hurricanes are rare, tropical storms can still bring significant impacts, especially along the southeastern U.S. coast and the Gulf. Historically, only about 6% of all Atlantic Basin storms occur in June, with August, September, and October being the busiest months. Last June saw unusual activity, including three named storms forming, with one taking a rare backward path in the Gulf of Mexico.",
