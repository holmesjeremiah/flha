                                        Hurricanes can cause significant financial hardship. Take steps to safeguard your finances before a storm strikes:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Document your valuables. Take photos or videos of your belongings to simplify the insurance claim process.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Consider flood insurance. Standard homeowner's insurance may not cover flood damage. Obtain a separate flood insurance policy to protect your assets.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Have an emergency fund. Save money to cover unexpected expenses during and after a hurricane, such as temporary housing, repairs, or replacing lost belongings.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Back up important financial documents. Scan or photocopy critical documents like insurance policies, bank statements, and proof of ownership for safekeeping outside your home.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Contact your bank or credit card company after the storm. Report lost or damaged cards and inquire about assistance programs they may offer during disaster recovery.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
